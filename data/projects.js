      task: 'My goal was to build a robust, **automated data pipeline** that could ingest, clean, and synchronize this disparate data in real-time.

I implemented rigorous data cleansing workflows to handle the 50k+ monthly records, ensuring data integrity. On top of this foundation, I built **DAX-driven Power BI dashboards** to visualize the new, clean dataset. I also conducted a gap analysis to identify specific procurement bottlenecks that the new data exposed.',

      situation:
        'IKEA\'s e-commerce analytics were limited to **country-level aggregates**, providing no visibility into regional performance variations. Sales, merchandising, and business navigation teams had no way to understand how online customer behavior differed across markets, cities, or postal areas. This meant promotional strategies and product placement decisions were applied uniformly — ignoring significant regional differences in customer preferences and engagement patterns.',
      task: 'My goal was to build a **granular analytics platform** that extended e-commerce insights from the country level down to PMA (Primary Market Area) and FSA (Forward Sortation Area) levels. The system needed to unify multiple data sources — including the EPISOD event framework, GA4, and traditional sales datasets — into a single, actionable intelligence layer for cross-functional teams.',
      action:
        'I designed the analytics architecture on **Google Cloud Platform**, integrating the EPISOD event framework (which captures real-time interactions from web, mobile apps, in-store kiosks, and digital planners) with traditional sales datasets. I built a multi-level geographic segmentation model (Country → Market → FSA → City) and created comprehensive **BI dashboards** tracking conversion funnels, product engagement, session analytics, and customer journey patterns across all digital touchpoints.',
      result:
        'The platform delivered **market-level granularity** that didn\'t exist before, enabling localized e-commerce strategies. The most impactful outcome: by identifying high-engagement products online and strategically displaying them in showroom hotspots, we **doubled in-store sales within 2 weeks** for targeted product categories — demonstrating measurable ROI from online-to-offline insights.',
